TODO:

implements the integration wiht redis for being shakh and work inside the networks



**create processing layer between sender and receiver--->for version 2

**send came name ip and .... to integrator tools----->for version.2



**add camera sender inside docker in to the  add_camera function ---> for version.3







---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1-handel GUI.py for new form of application

2- rewrite the sender with send to exchange approach

2- rewrite the receiver : create queue when want to receiver  based on the exchange of the sender program 

(with this approach we can understand and test the hardware limitation and distinct the network delay from Hardware delay)

3-rewrite the sender with recording scenarios 



4- Dockerize the sender application(when the esp32-cam and RTSP servers get okayed- right now I cant export the port from inside docker for receiving camera data)

5- create client app
